### Berke Baran Tozkoparan

I am an **Industrial Engineering** student at **Mudanya University** with a strong passion for data science, software development, and applying quantitative methods to solve complex problems.

My focus is on the intersection of engineering and data, particularly in building end-to-end **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Computer Vision** applications, from model training to deployment as interactive web services.

### Key Projects

* **Sensor Fault Detector (Predictive Maintenance)**
    * Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline using `scikit-learn` and `RandomForestClassifier` to perform multi-class fault classification (e.g., `Overload`, `Overheating`) from sensor data.
    * Deployed the model as an interactive web dashboard using **Gradio**, allowing for real-time predictions and data visualization.

* **Composite Battery Damage Detection (TÜBİTAK 2209 Project)**
    * A computer vision system designed to detect and classify damage in composite batteries using thermal imagery.
    * Utilized **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture, to train a custom object detection model for real-time fault identification.

* **AutoPredictor (ML Web Application)**
    * An end-to-end application for vehicle price prediction.
    * The backend API was built using **FastAPI** to serve model predictions, while the frontend featured interactive data visualizations using **Leaflet.js**.
